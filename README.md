# eCommmerceSite
Final project for Frontend / App vocational studies at Changemakers Education. 

## What

This will be a mock full-stack e-commerce site leveraging state handling, error handling, and headless CMS. The motivation behind the project is to get an insight into e-commerce platforms and to better my understanding of the above-listed technologies which is a deep dive into Frontend Development. 

The tech stack I will be using is:
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- TypeScript
- Express
- Nodemon
- Headless CMS (Strapi or Contenful depending on their free version)
- State management library (Zustand or Redux, and URL state handling)
- Mock E-com store API [DummyJSON](https://github.com/Ovi/DummyJSON)
- Toaster library for displaying fetching errors

### Functionality I am to learn

- Recursive navbar options
- Custom hook for fetching data
- Global state handling
- Better understanding of error handling
- Reusable and readable code

## How

I will submit a deployed E-commerce application with an Express server with a minimalistic design. 

### Acceptance criteria

- a landing page
  - with site products overview
- a header
  - with navbar
    - to category pages
  - with logo
  - with the site name
  - with a checkout button
- a category page
  - that displays products for a specific category 
- a product page
  - that displays the selected product
  - that shows variants of the product
  - that have a button to add the item to checkout
- a checkout page
  - that displays items the user has put in the checkout
  - the function to remove an item
  - the function to select the amount of the item
  - a form where the user can input their information with required fields
  - a button that finishes checkout - that has an easter egg functionality (ie. sends an email to the user with information about their checkout and thanks them for trying out the site)
 
## When

### The first week

Set up the project, research the technologies to be used, and start creating reusable base components and functions, including start populating the Headless CMS wit the API data. 

### The second week

Create the different pages and dynamic routing.

### The third week 

Make sure to finish up the pages and dynamic routing. 

### The fourth week 

Finish up the project and get ready for hand-in.
