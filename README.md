# eCommmerceSite
Final project for Frontend / App vocational studies at Changemakers Education. 

## What

This is going to be a mock e-commerce site leveraging state handling, error handling, and headless CMS. The motivation behind the project is to get an insight into e-commerce platforms and to better my understanding of the above-listed technologies which is a deep dive into Frontend Development. 

The tech stack I will be using is:
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- TypeScript ?
- Headless CMS (Strapi or Contenful depending on their free version)
- State management library (Zustand or Redux, and URL state handling)
- Mock E-com store API [DummyJSON](https://github.com/Ovi/DummyJSON)
- Toaster library for displaying errors 


## How

I will submit a deployed E-commerce application with a minimalistic design. 

### Acceptance criteria

- a landing page
  - with site products overview
- a header
  - with navbar
    - to category pages
  - with logo
  - with the site name
  - a checkout
- a category page
  - that displays products for a specific category 
- a product page
  - that displays the selected product
  - that shows variants of the product
  - that have a button to add the item to checkout
- a checkout page
  - that displays items the user has put in the checkout
  - the function to remove an item
  - the function to select the amount of the item
  - a form where the user can input their information with required fields
  - a button that finishes checkout - that has an easter egg functionality (ie. sends an email to the user with information about their checkout and thanks them for trying out the site)
 
## When

### The first week

Set up the project, research the technologies to be used, and start creating reusable base components and functions.

### The second week

Create the layout for the different pages and start looking into connecting the API and the headless CMS.

### The third week 

Implement the Headless CMS and API to display the products, including error handling

### The fourth week 

Finish up the project and get ready for hand-in.
